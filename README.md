# CodeDigital.github.io
My official portfolio website!
Check it out [here](https://codedigital.github.io/)

## Important Note
You will find that all the commits on the master branch are named "updates". This is because my development of the website occurs on the `redesign` branch. Feel free to check it out if you want to see the workings behind the site.

## The Making Of
This website is made in React, using `create-react-app`. Currently project hosting is made for `p5.js` projects and regular text projects, but I don't see any reason why other javascript libraries may not be included or used.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me if you need help with setting up a similar project/weblog hosting site, I know firsthand how tough it can be.
