# Phoenix Branch
Information regarding the transition to the `phoenix` branch can be found in the article here.

## Important Note
You will find that some of the commits on the `master` branch are named "updates". This is because my development of the website occurs on the `phoenix` branch. Feel free to check it out if you want to see the workings behind the site.

## The Making Of
This website is made in React, using `Next.js`. Currently project hosting is made for `p5.js` projects and regular text projects, but I don't see any reason why other javascript libraries may not be included or used.

### Technologies Used
#### Development
- NextJS
- NodeJS
- ReactJS
  - ReactDOM
  - HTML React Parser
  - PrismJS
- SCSS
  - React Static Plugin Sass

#### Projects/Deployment
- Github Pages
- JQuery
- P5JS
- More to Come! (That's not a library, I mean I might add more later..)

## Contact
Feel free to contact me if you need help with setting up a similar project/weblog hosting site, I know firsthand how tough it can be.
