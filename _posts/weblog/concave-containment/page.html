    <p><b>Preface</b><br>One of the best learning experiences for any aspiring game developer is to develop their own game engine. This may be a graphics engine or a physics engine. One can develop a set of transferrable skills and understandings of convetional knowledge relating to game development. It can even make you a better coder. Over the past year I have been working on learning the ins and outs of creating a simple 2-dimensional physics engine. While I don't see myself developing any games, it's been a fun experience, and has given me inspiration for other project ideas in the future.</p>

    <p><b>Running head-first into collisions</b><br>
    I was reading an article by <a href="https://twitter.com/RandyPGaul" target="_blank">Randy Gaul</a> on how to make your first game engine. I was particularly intrigued by the restrictive nature of the collision shapes supported in the article. Upon further research, it was clear that collisions of complex shapes with concave portions are not as easily implemented. This makes sense, of course, given that the geometry of these complex shapes (See figure 1) isn't clear cut. A point can be inside the shape's bound, but necessarily in the shape itself.</p>
