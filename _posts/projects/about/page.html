        <p class="about-p">CodeDigital is a portfolio website which I (Xavier Travers) will use to display different
            projects that I feel are noteworthy. While it will house some fun games to mess around with, I also intend
            to share it with potential employers as well. If you feel like I may be the right fit for your team, feel
            free to read about me below.</p>

            <p class="about-p">I am a <span id="about-age"></span> Year old with "design-focused" programming
                experience. Completed the IB Diploma, sporting an international education (Belgium, Thailand at the
                Bangkok Patana School and Indonesia at the Jakarta Intercultural School). Australian citizen, but only
                moved to Melbourne in August 2017. Able to speak/read/write in English and French and speak/read in

                While recently I have mainly been working on Javascript projects, I do have experience using the likes
                of Python, LUA and Java. I have found that my interest gravitates towards projects with great visual
                feedback, leading me to believe that I work well with a design focus.
                <br><br>
                Currently I am looking for part time work whilst I study and would be more than happy to take up any
                role just to gain experience programming in a business environment. Please feel free to <a

    <h2 class="about-h2">The Making of the Site</h2>
    <div class="about-me">
        <p class="about-p">Oh my, was this website a total pain to create. I had to learn React from scratch, only to
            learn that I couldn't use it the way I wanted. Despite all that, I cherish the learning experience. I now
            have a good mid-level understanding of React, and have a website as proof. The source code can be
            viewed on <a href="https://github.com/CodeDigital/CodeDigital.github.io/tree/phoenix"
                target="_blank">github</a>. Technically, it isn't even close to complete, yet. I will keep adding to it
            as I develop more fun stuff and continue to explore new concepts.</p>
