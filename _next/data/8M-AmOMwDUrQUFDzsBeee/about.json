While it will house some fun games to mess around with, I also intend\r\n            to share it with potential employers as well. If you feel like I may be the right fit for your team, feel\r\n            free to read about me below.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Mainly you will see projects I have worked on in <code>Javascript</code>, using the <code>p5js</code> library which can be found at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://p5js.org\">p5js.org</a>. Sometimes I will also include other works I have produced (such as music). \r\n        A good starting point would be my <a href=\"/clock-1\">Amazing Clock #1</a> project, an aesthetically pleasing redesign of a clock.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Another aim of mine is to publish \"Weblog\" posts on this website with topics ranging from a more in-depth look at a project I've worked on to a form of article about my findings (and perhaps even touching on my personal opinions at some points). \r\n        To get started, <a href=\"/weblog/the-phoenix-overhaul\">my article</a> on the transition of the website between two different platforms may prove an interesting read.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    <h2 class=\"about-h2\">Who is Xavier Travers?</h2>\r\n    <div class=\"about-me\">\r\n        <!-- <img src=\"/_posts/projects/about/assets/profile-photo.jpg\" alt=\"Profile Photo\"> -->\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p class=\"about-p\">I am a <span id=\"about-age\">19</span> Year old with \"design-focused\" programming\r\n                experience.

I had to learn React from scratch, only to\r\n            learn that I couldn't use it the way I wanted. Despite all that, I cherish the learning experience. I now\r\n            have a good mid-level understanding of React, and have a website as proof. The source code can be\r\n            viewed on <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeDigital/CodeDigital.github.io/tree/phoenix\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\">github</a>. Technically, it isn't even close to complete, yet. I will keep adding to it\r\n            as I develop more fun stuff and continue to explore new concepts.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <script>\r\n        const birthday = new Date();\r\n        birthday.setFullYear(2000);\r\n        birthday.setMonth(10)\r\n        birthday.setDate(3);\r\n\r\n        var age = new Date().getTime() - birthday.getTime();\r\n        age /= 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25;\r\n        age = Math.floor(age);\r\n\r\n        document.getElementById('about-age').innerText = age;\r\n        console.log('Age set to: ' + age);\r\n        // setInterval(function(){\r\n            \r\n        //     var age = new Date().getTime() - birthday.getTime();\r\n        //     age /= 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25;\r\n        //     age = Math.floor(age);\r\n\r\n        //     if(document.getElementById('about-age').innerText != age){\r\n        //         document.getElementById('about-age').innerText = age;\r\n        //         console.log('Age set to: ' + age);\r\n        //     }\r\n        // },100);\r\n    </script>\r\n    <script src=\"/_posts/projects/about/scripts.js\"></script>\r\n</div>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
