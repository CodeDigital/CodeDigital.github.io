    <p><b>Preface</b><br>One of the best learning experiences for any aspiring game developer is to develop their own game engine. This may be a graphics engine or a physics engine. One can develop a set of transferrable skills and understandings of convetional knowledge relating to game development. It can even make you a better coder. Over the past year I have been working on learning the ins and outs of creating a simple 2-dimensional physics engine. While I don't see myself developing any games, it's been a fun experience, and has given me inspiration for other project ideas in the future.</p>
